# French Number Converter Kotlin

This is a simple project to convert integer into literal French words, e.g. 42 => quarante-deux.

This project is run during the coding dojo organized by "Software Crafters Toulouse" meetup group.

Rather than solving the complete algorithm, the coding dojo focuses on applying TDD technics in Randori format.
